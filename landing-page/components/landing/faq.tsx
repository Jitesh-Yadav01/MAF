        question: "Does MAF add latency to my requests?",
        answer: "Minimal impact (< 5ms). MAF runs logic locally within your application's middleware layer. State lookups to Redis are highly optimized via pipeline.",
    },
    {
        question: "Is my data sent to your servers?",
        answer: "No. MAF operates as a self-hosted auditing sidecar or embedded library. Request payloads stay within your infrastructure. Only anonymized telemetry (if enabled) is sent for global threat intelligence.",
    },
    {
        question: "How does the AI Agent handling work?",
        answer: "For ambiguous requests that pass static rules but show high entropy, MAF can asynchronously queue them for LLM analysis. Ensure you configure PII filtering before enabling this feature.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can I run MAF in a serverless environment?",
        answer: "Yes. MAF is optimized for Vercel Edge, AWS Lambda, and Cloudflare Workers. It uses a stateless architecture with external session stores.",
