                MAF is an AI-assisted backend security service that <strong className="text-foreground">validates every incoming request</strong> at the application layer.
            </p>
            <p>
                In modern web architecture, backend requests cannot be trusted blindly. Traditional WAFs operate at the network edge but often lack context about the application's internal logic or user session state.
            </p>
            <p>
                MAF solves this by sitting closer to your application logic (or continuously communicating with it), preventing session abuse, device spoofing, malicious payloads, API abuse, automation attacks, and insider misuse.
            </p>

                    <strong>Key Differentiator:</strong> Unlike network WAFs, MAF is <em>application-aware</em> and <em>session-aware</em>, allowing for much more granular and deterministic security decisions.
